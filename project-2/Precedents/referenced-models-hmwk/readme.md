## RESTful App with Referenced Models

### Introduction

Your task is to create a RESTful Express App with two models. One model should be a User, and the other is up to you.

### Requirements

* Only logged in users can create a new resource.
* The user who created the resource must be stored inside the resource as a reference.
* Only the user who created the resource can edit or delete it.
* Only the user who created the resource should be able to see the edit or delete buttons.
* When a resource is displayed on the page (the `show` page), you should print out the username of the user who created it.
* Users should not be able to submit a form that is invalid.
* You should add front end form validations and error messages.

### Bonus

* Add comments.
* Style it up.

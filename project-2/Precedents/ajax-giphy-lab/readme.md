## Introduction

You're about to write a lot of AJAX-backed JavaScript using jQuery that will complete our little Gif app.

#### Thinking Like An Engineer

As we get into more complicated problems, we need to start thinking more and more like engineers. Engineers break down large problems into the smallest possible parts, and tackle each small part one at a time.

This is one of the major skills for web development!

#### Starter Code

This starter-code has gulp installed, so that we can play with ES6.
